Took on a programming challenge for Stanford's Code in Place 2023 to build the full snake game!

Below is really what inspired me to have a go at it:

> `If you are feeling very adventurous you could try and implement the full game of snake. The full game of snake is a hard challenge even for a well seasoned programmer. `

### In Michael Jordan's words, "So I took that personal!" 

## Here is how I approached the solution
> Milestone #1: Set up the World
> Milestone #2: Animate
> Milestone #3: Handle Key Press
> Milestone #4: Detecting collisions
> Milestone #5: Moving the goal
> Milestone #6: Grow snake

### Other extensions
> Get faster each time the player touches the goal.
> Keep track of points
> Add obstacles
